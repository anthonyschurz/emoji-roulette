Emoji Roulette is the app taking the Internet by storm. One part game, one part decision engine, Emoji Roulette combines the aesthetic appeal of emojis with the gamification of classic roulette.

Not sure what to eat tonight? Not sure what to wear today? Want a fun digital drinking game to play with your friends before going out? Emoji roulette allows users to customize the layout to fit their every needs. 

Emoji Roulette was built using html, js, jquery, bootstrap and animate.css. These technologies coalesce to create a highly functional and visually appealing browser game.

To get spinning, simply clone the Emoji Roulette repo to your machine--contributions are encouraged! It includes all the files you need to play, including bootstrap and animate.

Unsolved problems: emoji roulette doesn't text (stay tuned for v2). The emoji library needs to be built out to include all emoji use cases. Finally, I'd like to add the ability to create usernames and spin histories by user. See board here: https://trello.com/b/uuWwihuv/spin-wheel
